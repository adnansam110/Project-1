    <h2><u>About the Book</u></h2
      <p>
      Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the third in the Harry Potter series. The book follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban who they believe is one of Lord Voldemort's old allies.
      The book was published in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8 September 1999 by Scholastic Inc.[1][2][3][4] Rowling found the book easy to write, finishing it just a year after she had begun writing it. The book sold 68,000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and since has sold over three million in the country.[5] The book won the 1999 Whitbread Children's Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.
      The film adaptation of the novel was released in 2004, grossing more than $796 million and earning critical acclaim. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.

    <h2><u>Plot</u></h2>
      <p>
        Harry is back at the Dursleys' for the summer holidays, where he sees on Muggle television that a convict named Sirius Black has escaped from prison. After being provoked by his Aunt Marge, Harry accidentally inflates her, and runs away from home, fearing expulsion from school. After being picked up by the Knight Bus, he travels to the Leaky Cauldron, where Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, asks Harry to stay in Diagon Alley for his own protection. While there, he meets his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
        Before leaving for Hogwarts, Harry learns from Arthur Weasley that Sirius Black is a convicted murderer from the wizarding world, and that Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban to kill Harry. On the way to Hogwarts, a Dementor (an Azkaban prison guard which feeds on positive thoughts) boards the train, causing Harry to relive his parents' deaths before fainting. The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, protects Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the Dementor. They later learn that Dementors will be patrolling the school in an attempt to catch Black. Although Professor Lupin is popular with his students, he seems to be hated by the Potions master, Snape.
        During a Quidditch match, Harry faints and falls off his broomstick after Dementors invade the field.
        <br><br>
        His broom is blown away and smashed by the Whomping Willow, a violent tree in the grounds. Afterwards, Professor Lupin teaches Harry how to defend himself from Dementors by use of the Patronus charm.
        Harry uses The Marauder's Map (a map of Hogwarts marking all its inhabitants and secret tunnels, given to him by Fred and George Weasley) for an unauthorised visit to the magical village of Hogsmeade. Harry overhears some of his teachers and Fudge, and learns that Black was a friend of Harry's parents and was entrusted with the secret of their whereabouts. However, he betrayed the Potters, leading to their murder by Voldemort's hand. Finally, Black killed twelve Muggles and his former friend Peter Pettigrew, before being taken to Azkaban.
        Ron and Hermione's friendship later suffers when Ron believes that Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, ate his rat, Scabbers. Hermione also gets Harry's new anonymously-given Christmas present, a top-of-the-range replacement broomstick, confiscated for fear it might be jinxed by Sirius Black. Hermione becomes severely stressed by her high number of classes, some of which even seem to be at the same time.
        Throughout the year, Harry repeatedly sees a large, black dog stalking him. 
        <br><br>
        His Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, informs him that this is the Grim, an omen of death. During Harry's Divination exam, Trelawney goes into a trance and predicts that Voldemort's servant will escape and return to him.
        Meanwhile, Hagrid's hippogriff Buckbeak is in danger of being executed by the Ministry of Magic, after injuring Draco Malfoy, who provoked Buckbeak. Despite Hermione's and Ron's efforts to defend the hippogriff, they and Harry seemingly hear Buckbeak executed as they leave Hagrid's hut. While at Hagrid's, however, Hermione discovers Scabbers hiding there.
        Scabbers escapes from Ron, who gives chase. 
        <br><br>
        The large, block dog appears and attacks Ron, then drags him into a tunnel under the Whomping Willow. Crookshanks (who seems to be in league with the dog), Harry, and Hermione follow them to the Shrieking Shack, a haunted house in Hogsmeade. They discover that the dog is Sirius Black in animal form. Harry disarms Black, and intends to kill him, but finds he can not.
        Lupin enters, and embraces Black as a friend.
        <br><br>
        He explains that although he believed Black to have betrayed the Potters, he realises now that it was Peter Pettigrew. He admits that he is a werewolf, and that when at school, his friends (Black, Pettigrew, and Harry's father James Potter) learned to transform into animals to keep Lupin company during his transformations into a wolf. Lupin explains that Scabbers is Pettigrew in his animal form; he faked his own death, framing Black for the murders, and has been hiding from Black since his escape from Azkaban.
        Snape, who still holds a childhood grudge with Lupin and his friends, arrives to apprehend Black but is knocked unconscious by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who believe Black to be innocent.
        <br><br>
        Lupin and Black transform Pettigrew into human form and prepare to kill him, but Harry stops them, as he feels his father would not have wanted it; he convinces them to send Pettigrew to Azkaban instead.
        As they attempt to bring Pettigrew back to Hogwarts, the full moon transforms Lupin into a wolf. 
        <br><br>
        Lupin, not in his own mind, attacks them, and in the confusion Pettigrew transforms into a rat and escapes. Harry, Hermione, and Black are chased to the shore of the lake, where they are set upon by Dementors. They are rescued by the Patronus of a figure on the opposite shore, whom Harry thinks is his father.
        Reawakening later in the hospital wing, Harry and Hermione are told that Black has been sentenced to have his soul sucked out by Dementors. Professor Dumbledore tells Harry and Hermione to use Hermione's time-turner, a device she has been using to attend simultaneous classes, to go back in time and save Buckbeak and Sirius. They rescue Buckbeak from execution, and later watch themselves attacked by Dementors at the lake. Harry realises that the figure he saw was not his father, but himself, and casts the Patronus charm that drives away the Dementors. Harry and Hermione ride Buckbeak to the tower where Black is being held and break him out. Black escapes on Buckbeak.
        Harry and Hermione return to the hospital wing to close the timeline. 
        <br><br>
        Enraged by the escape of Black, Snape lets slip that Lupin is a werewolf, forcing him to resign. Harry returns to Kings Cross with his friends, and receives a letter from Black, whom the Potters made Harry's godfather, giving him permission to visit Hogsmeade next year.
